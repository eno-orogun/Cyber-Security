            <h1>A Private Sandbox Network</h1>
            <h1 class="left-align">Project Aims</h1>
            <p>
                The aim of this project is to create a private sandbox network consisting of three machines which are isolated from the real-world network, avoiding risks to live systems while simulating real-world network scenarios. The network consists of multiple virtual machines (VMs) using VirtualBox. The VMs are configured within a private IP address range (192.168.27.1 to 192.168.27.10). The networking concepts such as IP subnetting, network interface configuration, design, server setup, planning, and organizational strategies were applied.
            </p>
            <h1 class="left-align">Configuration</h1>
            <p>
                For the virtual machines, I chose to use Ubuntu Desktop for the desktop environment, Ubuntu Server for the gateway router, and Bitnami WordPress for the web application server.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used Ubuntu Desktop as it is a secure operating system that is commonly used and comes with the latest technologies, such as applications, libraries, and toolchains. Ubuntu Desktop also provides better performance compared to Windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used Ubuntu Server as my gateway router, as it comes with many benefits. It is easily customizable, allowing you to install the packages you require. It is compatible with a large variety of hardware and software and has built-in security to protect against vulnerabilities and threats.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used Bitnami WordPress for the web application server as it is a free, open-source application that is already pre-configured, providing the required components. It simplifies management, making updates and administration via the Bitnami interface straightforward.
            </p>
            <p>
                I connected the Ubuntu Desktop to the Ubuntu Server, which serves as the default gateway to the Bitnami WordPress web application server. I then checked that they could communicate with each other by pinging from each machine.
                The first challenge I faced was trying to configure the Ubuntu Server. I downloaded and installed it onto the virtual machine (VirtualBox), but I was unable to configure the IP addresses. I resolved this issue by removing it entirely from VirtualBox and reinstalling Ubuntu Server during the installation process, which no longer posed an issue for me.
                Another challenge I faced was configuring the IP address for the Bitnami web application server. I made a mistake in creating the match file for the IP address; when specifying the address name, I named it "address" rather than "Address," which caused the file not to save. Whenever I tried to display the address I had created using the command “ip addr,” I received an error. I troubleshot the issue, discovered my error, and resolved it by changing the lowercase "a" to an uppercase "A."

            <h1 class="left-align"> Configurations </h1> 
            <h1 class="left-align"> Ubuntu Desktop 22.04: </h1> 
            <p> The desktop was configured to have one network interface – one adapter on the internal network.</p>

            <p>The internal network enables the VMs to communicate with each other preventing them from being exposed to external networks allowing for running services which shouldn’t have public access.</p>

            <p>To ensure security the internal network limits network access and reduces attacks to the network as the VMs have the ability to exchange data securely without exposure to external threats.</p>

            <p>Configuring the internal network adapter simplified the network settings and enabled the management of IP addressing and routing within the internal network without concerns for the external network configurations.</p>

            <p>See a screenshot of the adapter below:</p>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eno-orogun/Cyber-Security/blob/gh-pages/Ubuntu%20Desktop%20-%20Adapter%201.jpg" alt="Ubuntu Desktop Adapter Setting" />
            
            <p>For the ubuntu Desktop one ethernet was configured: enp0s3</p>
            <p>enp0s3 configuration below:</p>

            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eno-orogun/Cyber-Security/blob/gh-pages/Ubuntu%20Desktop%20-%20Ethernet%20enp0s3%20Config.jpg" alt="Ubuntu Desktop Ethernet Setting" />
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eno-orogun/Cyber-Security/blob/gh-pages/Ubuntu%20Desktop%20-%20Ethernet%20enp0s3%20IPv4%20Config.jpg" alt="Ubuntu Desktop IPv4 Setting" />
            
            <p>I configured one Ethernet Adapter to enable the VM to connect to the network which allows communication with other devices and other VMs.  It acts as a service host enabling clients to access services such as the Bitnami web application server which is connected to the network. For performance monitoring of network traffic,
            the Ethernet adapter is able to pinpoint performance issues, bottlenecks and as well as optimize the VM’s network usage</p>

            <h1 class="left-align"> Ubuntu Server 24.04 gateway router </h1> 
            <p>Three network adapters were configured for the gateway router, two internal network adapters and one NAT 
            (network access translation). The two internal network adapters are used to create distinct internal network and 
            this segmentation enhances management of applications and services. </p> 

            <p>Separate internal network adapters isolated the different services, reducing the risk of lateral movement in case 
            there was a security breach </p>

            <p>The NAT adapter empowers the VM to have access to the internet and still keeping the internal networks isolated. 
            Which enables the VMs to download updates or communicate with external services preventing exposure to the internal 
            environment. </p>

            <p>Three different Ethernet interfaces were configured for the gateway: enp0s3, enp0s8, enp0s9. </p>
  
            <p>The three interfaces were also configured for the Ubuntu gateway router as setting up enp0s3, enp0s8, and enp0s9 as the gateway enables the VM to route traffic between 
            different networks providing communication between internal devices. </p>

            <p>Assigning the interfaces as the gateway centralizes the network traffic control enabling ease in management of data flow and 
            implementing policies for security when required. Configuring the interface as the gateway isolated the network traffic, 
            providing enhanced monitoring and security measures.</p>

            <p>I used multiple interfaces to segment the network traffic e.g one interface for management of traffic while another deals with
            application data or services.  Distribution of the traffic across different interfaces empowers improvement in network 
            performance in balancing the network load.</p>

            <p>Redundancy is enabled with the utilization of the multiple interfaces and if one interface fails, the others can continue to 
            handle traffic.</p>

            <h1 class="left-align"> Bitnami WordPress 6.6 Web Application Server </h1> 
            <p>Only one network adapter was configured for the web application server and it was set to inet2 which is a separate internal network for isolation purpose and providing security 
            such as an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access. </p>
