Project Aims

The aim of this project is to create a private sandbox network consisting of three machines which are isolated from the real-world network and avoiding risks to live systems and simulates real-world network scenarios. The network consists of multiple virtual machines (VMs) using VirtualBox. The VMs are configured within a private IP address range (192.168.27.1 to 192.168.27.10). |The networking concepts such as IP subnetting, network Interface configuration, design, server setup, planning and organizational strategies where applied.

Configuration
For the Virtual machines I chose to use Ubuntu Desktop for the desktop environment, Ubuntu Server for the gateway router and Bitnami WordPress for the web application server.  
I used Ubuntu Desktop as it is a secure operating system which is commonly used and comes with the latest technologies such as applications, libraries and toolchains. Ubuntu Desktop also comes with better performance compared to windows.

I used Ubuntu Server as my gateway router as it comes with lots of benefits as it is easily customizable so you can easily install packages that you require.  It is compatible with a large variety of hardware and software. It has built-in security which protects against vulnerabilities and threats.

I used Bitnami WordPress for the web application server as it is a free open-source application which is already pre-configured providing the required components. It provides easy management simplifying updates and the management of Bitnami interface.

I connected the Ubuntu Desktop to the Ubuntu Server and the Ubuntu Server which is the default Gateway to the Bitnami WordPress web application Server. I then checked that they can communicate with each other by pinging each other from each machine. 

The first challenge I faced was trying to configure the Ubuntu server. I downloaded it and installed it onto the virtual machine (VitualBox) but wasn’t able to configure the IP addresses. I resolved this issue by removing it entirely from vritualBox and attempted re-installing Ubuntu Server during the installation process and this no longer posed an issue for me.
Another challenge I faced was issues configuring the IP address for Bitnami web application server.  I made a mistake in creating the match file for the IP address as I when specifying the address name I named it as “address” rather than “Address” and this made the file not save. Whenever I tried to display the address I had created using the command “ip addr” I received an error. I therefore troubleshot and discovered the error I made and resolved it by amending the letter a to a capital a.
